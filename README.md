# Smart-Estate
CS 482 Data Mining Project
Orion Cua

Company Name: Smart Estate Inc.
Pitch: Smart Estate will make sure you know every detail of a property to make the best decision.

Proposal:
The title of the Kaggle competition that I selected is titled "House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques".
There are many factors and details that go into the final sale price of a property. In this project, I aim to predict the sale price of a property given an expansive set of variables. It is easy to understand the impact that the number of bedrooms and bathrooms may have on the price of a property, but it is very interesting to look into the impact of more abstract variables such as proximity to railroads and the material of the roof. In order to provide more context and background on this project, I will look into each variable to understand what exactly it is describing. 
In this project, I will be using the dataset that is provided in the competition. The data is presented in a CSV format. The dataset provided contains about 3,000 entries, each with around 80 variables. In order to analyze this data, the plan is to utilize ensemble methods, namely random forests in order to analyze this data. There are many different implementations found on Kaggle to predict the sale price of the houses. I plan on reviewing many of them to get an idea on how I can manipulate and analyze the data, however I also plan on incorporating some additional insights to determine which variables are the most impactful in determining the actual sale price of the house.
The goal of the project is to use ensemble methods machine learning to predict the sale price of a house with given variables. Qualitatively, I will be using plots to showcase the correlation of the variables to the resulting price. I will also use a graph to display the final price predictions against the actual prices. Quantitatively, the Mean-Squared Error formula will be used to evaluate the accuracy of the predictions.
